# What is Flutter
Originally developed by Google and now managed by ECMA, Flutter offers free and open-source UI development support. With one programming language and one codebase, users can create beautiful, natively compiled mobile applications with this UI toolkit. A framework like Flutter allows you to build mobile applications for iOS and Android in a truly platform-independent way. Developers consider it to be the fastest and most expressive way to build native apps. Due to its simplicity, high performance resulting from its development, rich user interface, Flutter will have a significant impact on the development of high-quality, feature-packed mobile applications in the near future.
